# Test Post 3

<!-- page_excerpt -->
This is a third test post showing how excerpts and the post index will work. There needs to be a decent amount
of content in this first paragraph for **testing** purposes. It will be interesting to see how this looks on the
index page. _Will it look ok?_

What happens if the excerpt is longer than a single paragraph?
<!-- endpage_excerpt -->

This paragraph is just here to make sure we don't excerpt the whole post...
